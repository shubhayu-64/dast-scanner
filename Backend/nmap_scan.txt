|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.
